        Here's some more information on how I currently work when designing/developing websites.
      </span>

    <div>
      <h4> Design </h4>
      <span>If there is no design to work from,
        I usually start with a paper sketch
        or occasionally a Figma design. These were 2 designs I had for this portfolio:

      <img src="Images/projects/workflow1.png" alt="Figma Design" loading="lazy" class="lazy" />


      <span>
        I like out-of-the-box, yet still useful, designs.
        For the Saving Aid,
        there were also some along-the-way
        iterations based on feedback:

    <div>
      <h4>React and file structure</h4>
      <span>
        So far I've worked with functional components in React and have used Redux for state management.
        To keep a good overview, I try to seperate files and stylesheets in a logical way:
      </span>
      <img src="Images/projects/recipeFileStructure.png" alt="File structure" loading="lazy" class="lazy" />
      <span>
        For backing up code, I use GIT(lab/hub), and comment and document (complex) code so that it's hopefully
        still
        usable in the future, for me and for others:)
      </span>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h4>Responsive design</h4>
      <span>
        To ensure responsiveness, I usually use CSS flexboxes, breakpoints, and/or the (Bootstrap) grid
        system and continuously check the result, either via browser inspect, or by accessing localhost from
        phones/tablets on secure Wi-fi.
      </span>

    </div>
    <div>
      <h4>Styling</h4>
      <span>
        I've recently started using SCSS (SASS) pre-processing to maintain a better overview of code, and use
        nested
        styles. In React I use style modules to avoid style clashes.
      </span>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h4>Back-end</h4>
      <span>
        I briefly worked with PHP/SQL for my master's thesis (based on tutorials), and for this portfolio I used
        php to separate code into smaller chunks;
      </span>

    </div>
    <div>
      <h4> SEO </h4>
      <span>
        For basic 'search engine optimization' (as far as I'm familiar),
        I use relevant tags, check page sizes, loading
        speed, and use image compression/lazy loading where possible.
      </span>
      <img src="Images/projects/SEO2.png" alt="SEO" loading="lazy" class="lazy" />

    </div>
    <div>
      <h4> Getting Feedback / user testing </h4>
      <span>
        I have limited experience with user testing (in general) from my studies,
        e.g. with paper prototypes or mock-ups.
      </span>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h4></h4>
      <span>
        This is what works well for me at the
        moment, but I'm hoping to learn better methods
        and work with and learn from others in the future,
        and be part of a larger team!
